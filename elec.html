    <p>The electrical engineering discipline focuses on the study and application of electronics, electricity, and electromagnetism. Electrical engineers perform essential functions in a wide variety of industries. Their roles are also extremely varied ranging from those performing specific development, research, or maintenance activities to those managing large organisations.</p>

    <p>Electrical engineering courses and electrician courses are offered to cater for those wishing to enter the industry. In addition to this, courses are available for seasoned professionals who need to stay abreast of the latest developments in the industry or wish to branch off into another area of business. An MBA, for example, is a popular choice for engineers as it provides them with the very important management and softer skills required for senior positions, which they often hold. These are not a major focus of their undergraduate studies. Safety training is also essential for all engineering disciplines since regulatory compliance requires strict adherence.</p>
